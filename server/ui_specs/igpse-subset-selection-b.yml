      Use the visualization below to select which patients to include in the
      two groups for the final survivability analysis.  The boxes on the left
      represent patients classified in the various clusters based on the mRNA
      expression data; the boxes on the right are for the clusters based on the
      miRNA data.  The ribbons in the middle represent where patients overlap
      between the two sets of clusters.
