    # two-character string describing what match to perform

    # Each character can be either 'c' for 'columns' or 'r' for 'rows'.  The

    # second input files to match, respectively.
    #
    # For examples: "rr" specifies that the rows in the first file should be
    # matched with the rows in the second file, and "cr" specifies that the
    # columns in the first file should be matched with the rows in the second
    # file.
