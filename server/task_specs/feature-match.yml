    # comma-separated string of matches to perform
    #
    # Each match is a two-character string, where each character can be either
    # 'c' for 'columns' or 'r' for 'rows'.  The first and second characters of
    # each match specify which entries from the first and second input files to
    # match, respectively.
    #
    # For examples: "rr" specifies that the rows in the first file should be
    # matched with the rows in the second file, and "cr" specifies that the
    # columns in the first file should be matched with the rows in the second
    # file.  A matches value of "rr,cr" specifies that both matches should be
    # performed and their results returned in match_result.
